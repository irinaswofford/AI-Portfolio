## Conversational AI Portfolio Agent (Alessandra)
Alessandra is an AI-powered assistant designed to interact with users and provide information related to my portfolio of projects.
It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI to understand user queries and generate relevant answers based on my predefined content.


## Features:

## In-Scope Questions:

These questions are related directly to my portfolio. For example:
"How do you manage stakeholders?"
"Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning."
The AI will respond immediately with a predefined answer taken from my JSON data.

## Out-of-Scope Questions:

For questions not covered within my portfolio data (e.g., "How to build a rocket?"), the AI will:
- Ask the user for their email address.
- Use Google search results to provide an answer.
- Generate a Gmail draft with the response and relevant search results
- I will review the draft before sending it to the user.


## Sidebar Navigation:
The sidebar contains the various sections of my portfolio, allowing users to easily navigate and explore my projects. 
This is where the user can select the specific project or area they'd like to learn more about. Sections include:

- Home - Overview of my portfolio.
- AI Project Management Experience - Detailing my expertise in managing AI-driven projects.
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Showcasing my work in RPA and NLP integration.
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) - Detailing my experience with RNNs and LSTMs.
- Supervised Learning - Projects focused on supervised learning methodologies.
- Unsupervised Learning - Projects related to unsupervised learning techniques.
- Conversational AI fine-tuned with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - How I've applied RAG techniques to conversational AI.
- Natural Language Processing & Generative AI - A focus on NLP and generative AI in my projects.
