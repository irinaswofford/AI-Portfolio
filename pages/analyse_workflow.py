    This project demonstrates **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** for automating lead submissions and follow-up emails. It integrates with a simulated **CRM** to capture leads, perform **sentiment analysis** on competitor reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generate automated email templates**.
    By automating these tasks, businesses can save time, make more informed decisions, and improve their engagement with leads and customers.
