        Defined the product vision and roadmap for multiple AI solutions aligned to user needs and business goals (e.g., automation, personalization, fraud detection).
        Led cross-functional teams (Data Scientists, MLOps, Engineers, UX) through the full lifecycle â€” from ideation to MVP delivery and iteration.
        Scoped and prioritized product features based on technical feasibility, stakeholder input, and ROI using tools like JIRA, ClickUp, and Aha!.
        Developed AI risk governance frameworks, including Risk Management Matrices (privacy, model bias, regulatory compliance), and assigned ownership for mitigation.
        Ensured delivery on time and budget, creating Agile timelines with milestone tracking, and proactively managing scope creep.
        Communicated progress to execs and business stakeholders, tailoring updates to technical and non-technical audiences.       
        Launched internal AI tools  to enhance user engagement and demonstrate applied GenAI capabilities.

    ### Risk Management Matrix:
    To visualize and tackle potential risks, I create a Risk Management Matrix, detailing:
    - Risks such as Data Privacy, Model Bias, and Regulatory Compliance
    - Likelihood, impact, and specific mitigation strategies for each
    - Assignment of ownership to the responsible teams (e.g., Data Governance, Compliance)
